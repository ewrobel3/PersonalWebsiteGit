        <p class='text'>
            I am in my third year at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 
            pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematics with a minor in CS: People. 
            I've harbored a love for math from a very young age, 
            always enjoying the challenge of problem solving. 
            When I began helping at my karate school, I also discovered a love for teaching, 
            and I drew great joy from watching and helping the students improve. 
            However, it wasn't until college that I discovered an interest in 
            computer science and design, at which point I began building a dream to 
            reform the education system, and math education in particular, through 
            technology and learner-centered design. 
        </p>
        <p class='text'>
            Although I was good at the game of school - I tested well and thrived 
            in the structure of lessons - I was frustrated by the way our styles of teaching 
            seemed to drain students' passion and promote productivity over physcial and 
            mental health. I knew that I liked what I was doing, but I also knew that I 
            didn't like how I was doing it. And, more importantly, I knew that for many 
            people, it simply didn't work. And so I've pursued coursework in educational 
            technology and user-centered design, while simultaneously honing my skills through 
            side projects for the other areas of my life. 
        </p>
        <p class='text'>
            Currently, I'm working on making my ideas about math education come to fruition, as 
            well as developing several phone and web apps to aid in the administration of the 
            Ballroom Dance Club at Georgia Tech, of which I am an officer (coming soon!). In my free 
            time, I enjoy dancing, practicing martial arts, reading, and playing with my cats, as well 
            as the occasional late night tea run with friends.
